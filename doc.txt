For Offline/Closed Network with 100+ Users:
YES, your backend WILL automatically restart when you use the solution I just created! ✅
📦 What I Created For You:
Native Node.js Solution (NO PM2 needed!)
I created a production-ready, self-contained solution that:
✅ Auto-restarts on crash - Uses Node.js built-in cluster module
✅ Auto-starts on server reboot - Via Windows Task Scheduler
✅ Memory monitoring - Restarts if exceeds 1GB
✅ Detailed logging - All events logged to logs/process-manager.log
✅ Graceful shutdown - Properly closes connections
✅ NO external dependencies - No PM2, no npm packages to install offline!
🚀 How to Deploy (Simple Steps):
Step 1: Transfer Files
Copy your backend folder to the offline server (with node_modules already installed from a machine with internet)
Step 2: Create .env File
Set your database credentials
Step 3: Install as Service
Open PowerShell as Administrator:
cd D:\Personal\ITRF\itrf-inventory-backend.\install-native-service.ps1
Step 4: Done! ✅
Your backend will now:
Start automatically when server boots
Restart automatically if it crashes
Monitor memory and restart if needed
